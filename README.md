# Reinforcement Learning algorithms tested in Atari

Implementation of SARSA with Linear Function Approximation using the Basic and B-PROS features described in [1].

Code initially based on the implementation of https://github.com/wulfebw/playing_atari

Backgrounds for Atari games taken from https://github.com/mcmachado/ALEResearch
